# MobWeb_SaveAddressAsDefault extension for Magento

When the customer enters a new billing or shipping address during checkout and "Save in address book" is checked for this address, it will be saved as the default billing or shipping address.

This makes sense in a B2C store because for such a customer, their latest address is usually their default address.

## Installation

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible.
